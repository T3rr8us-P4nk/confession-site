        <h1>A Confession</h1>
        <p>Hi Jizel,</p>
        <p>I have something I've been wanting to tell you. I think your pretty amazing and beautiful, and I've developed a little crush on you.</p>
        <img src="https://i.giphy.com/gDfteqLchLcRTtjAD7.webp" alt="heart">
        <p>I know this might be unexpected, but I couldn't keep it to myself any longer.</p>
        <p>I'm not expecting you to accept my feelings, I just wanted to be honest and let you know how I feel.</p>
        <p>Would you be interested in going out sometime?</p>
